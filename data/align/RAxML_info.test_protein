IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Bacteria_TA06_uncultured_SMTZ1_40 and Bacteria_TA06_uncultured_SMTZ_40 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file /Users/WRShoemaker/GitHub/LTDE/data/align/ribosomal_protein_seqs_align_concat.fa.reduced

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 1000 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
